# SWE-573 Purposefull Community Platform
This repository is created for the lecture "SWE573 - Software Development Practice" @ Boğaziçi University Software Engineering Department for fall 2019 semester.

This project is about a Purposefull Community Platform where registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images and etc, on moderated topics. 

Topics are created by community builders who are able to define the community specific datatypes. 

The site  recommends its users (registered or anonymous) related topics based on constructed relations between these topics using tagged Wikidata information.

Intended use of these topics are;
* Ability to accumulate information stored on these topics.
* Ability to request/provide structured information in a fast and supervised way.
